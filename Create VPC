Step 1: Open VPC Dashboard
  1.Login to AWS Management Console
  2.Search for VPC
  3.Click VPC Dashboard
Step 2: Create a VPC
  1.Click “Create VPC”
  2.Choose VPC only (if you want to build everything manually)
  3.Enter details:
        *.Name tag: My-VPC
        *.IPv4 CIDR block: 10.0.0.0/16 (65,536 IPs)
        *.IPv6 CIDR block: Optional
        *.Tenancy: Default (shared hardware)
  4.Click Create VPC .
Step 3: Create Subnets
We need at least one Public subnet and one Private subnet.
  1.Go to Subnets → Create Subnet
  2.Select your VPC (My-VPC)
  3.Pick an Availability Zone (e.g., us-east-1a)
  4.Enter CIDR:
        *Public Subnet → 10.0.1.0/24
        *.Private Subnet → 10.0.2.0/24
  5.Enable Auto-assign Public IPv4 for the Public Subnet
Step 4: Create Internet Gateway (IGW)
  1.Go to Internet Gateways → Create IGW
  2.Name it My-IGW
  3.Attach it to My-VPC
Step 5: Configure Route Tables
  1.Go to Route Tables → Create Route Table
        *.Name: Public-RT
        *.VPC: My-VPC
  2.Add a route:
        *.Destination: 0.0.0.0/0
        *.Target: Internet Gateway (My-IGW)
  3.Associate this route table with Public Subnet
                Now Public Subnet has internet access.
Step 6: (Optional) Create NAT Gateway
Private subnets usually need outbound internet (for updates, patches).
  1.Allocate an Elastic IP
  2.Go to NAT Gateway → Create NAT Gateway
        *.Place it in the Public Subnet
        *.Attach the Elastic IP
  3.Create another Route Table → Private-RT
        *.Route 0.0.0.0/0 → NAT Gateway
        *.Associate with Private Subnet
Step 7: Create Security Groups
  1.Go to Security Groups → Create SG
Example:
        *.Web-SG: Allow HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), SSH (22)
        *.DB-SG: Allow MySQL (3306) only from Web-SG
At this point, you have a working VPC with:
  *.Public Subnet (for web servers, bastion hosts)
  *.Private Subnet (for databases, backend apps)
  *.Internet Gateway for inbound/outbound internet
  *.NAT Gateway for private subnet outbound traffic
