A Docker volume is a special storage mechanism for persisting data used by Docker containers.
It keeps data outside the container’s writable layer, so your data isn’t lost when the container stops, restarts, or is deleted.

Why use Docker volumes?

    Persistence: Keep database files, logs, uploads, etc. safe beyond a container’s life.
    Sharing: Multiple containers can access the same data.
    Performance: Volumes are optimized for Docker’s storage driver.
    Portability: Easier to back up, restore, or move data.
