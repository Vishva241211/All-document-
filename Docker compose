Docker Compose is a tool that lets you define and run multi-container Docker applications using a simple YAML file (docker-compose.yml).
Instead of running multiple docker run ... commands manually, you can describe all your containers, networks, 
and volumes in one file and bring them up with a single command.

Why use Docker Compose?
    Multi-container apps: Easily run apps that need multiple services (e.g., web app + database).
    Single command start/stop: docker compose up / docker compose down.
    Reproducible: Same environment for every developer or server.
    Built-in networking: Services can talk to each other by name.

Basic Structure of docker-compose.yml:
version: "3.9"  # Docker Compose file format version

services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - ./html:/usr/share/nginx/html

  db:
    image: mysql:8
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: rootpass
      MYSQL_DATABASE: mydb
      MYSQL_USER: myuser
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: mypass
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/mysql

volumes:
  db_data:
