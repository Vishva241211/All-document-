What is Route 53?
  Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service provided by AWS.
It’s used to:
  1.Register domain names (like mywebsite.com).
  2.Route internet traffic to AWS resources (like EC2, S3, CloudFront, ELB).
  3.Check health of resources and perform DNS failover.
Key Features of Route 53:
1.Domain Registration
  *.Buy and manage domain names directly from AWS.
2.DNS Routing
  *.Convert domain names (like example.com) into IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1).
  *.Supports multiple routing policies.
3.Health Checks & Monitoring
  *.Continuously checks endpoints (web servers, apps) and redirects traffic if one fails.
4.Traffic Flow Policies
  *.Allows latency-based routing, geolocation routing, and weighted routing.

Routing Policies in Route 53
  1.Simple Routing → One record, one resource (basic DNS).
  2.Weighted Routing → Distribute traffic based on percentages (e.g., 70% to EC2-A, 30% to EC2-B).
  3.Latency-Based Routing → Send users to the region with the lowest latency.
  4.Failover Routing → Active-passive setup (if primary fails, Route 53 redirects to backup).
  5.Geolocation Routing → Send traffic based on user’s geographic location.
  6.Geoproximity Routing → Based on user + resource location with bias control.
  7.Multi-Value Answer → Return multiple IPs for DNS query (like round robin).
